Start
Input a sentence character by character (end with a period ".").

Initialize:
    - length = 0 (to count the total number of characters)
    - words = 0 (to count the number of words)
    - vowels = 0 (to count the number of vowels)

WHILE (character != '.'):
    Increment length by 1
    IF (character == ' ' AND previous_character != ' '):
        Increment words by 1
    END_IF
    IF (character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')):
        Increment vowels by 1
    END_IF
    Read the next character
END_WHILE

Increment words by 1 (to count the last word before the period)

Output:
    - "Length of sentence: ", length
    - "Number of words: ", words
    - "Number of vowels: ", vowels
End
